# 🎮 JUICY PHYSICS + PARTICLES COMPLETE!

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED - Ready for Dopamine Testing  
**Approach**: Avian2D Physics + Custom Sprite Particles (optimized for game feel)

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### ✅ Professional Physics (Avian2D)
**Added to player**:
- Smooth momentum-based movement (lerp acceleration)
- Quick deceleration when near target
- Knockback on hits (200 units away from enemy)
- Feels responsive yet weighty

**Added to enemies**:
- Steering behaviors (smooth pursuit, no instant turning)
- Momentum and velocity
- Knockback on trail hits (250 units)
- Natural-looking curved movement

### ✅ Sprite-Based Particle System
**Why sprites instead of Hanabi?**:
- Simpler, lighter (~150KB savings)
- Easier to tune for that **dopamine hit**
- Perfect for 2D top-down aesthetic
- Zero API compatibility issues

**Death Explosions** (20 particles):
- Radial burst from enemy center
- Randomized speed (100-200 units/s)
- Orange-red-yellow gradient
- 0.6s lifetime with fade
- Particle size varies (8-12px)

**Pickup Rings** (12 particles):
- Circle expansion (25px radius)
- Color-matched to power-up type:
  - ❤️ Heart: Pink/Red
  - 🛡️ Shield: Cyan/Blue
  - ⚔️ Damage: Gold/Orange
- 0.4s lifetime with fade
- 100 units/s outward velocity

### ✅ Screen Shake (Trauma System)
**Intensity levels**:
- Enemy kill: 0.2 + combo multiplier (max 0.6)
- Player hit: 0.5 (heavy shake)
- Player death: 1.0 (massive shake)
- Power-up pickup: 0.15 (light shake)

**Technical**:
- Trauma decays at 3.0/second
- Shake intensity = trauma²
- Random offset ±20px at max trauma
- Camera resets smoothly when done

### ✅ Knockback System
**Player knockback**:
- 200 units away from hit direction
- Decays at 8.0x per second
- Adds satisfying "impact" feel

**Enemy knockback**:
- 250 units on trail hit
- Prevents instant re-hits
- Creates visual feedback

### ✅ Hit Freeze
- 0.04s brief pause on enemy kills
- Creates "impact moment"
- Enhances satisfaction of kills
- Subtle enough to not feel laggy

---

## 🎰 Dopamine Optimization

### Kill Feedback Loop
```
Trail hits enemy →
  1. Knockback pushes enemy away (visual)
  2. Screen shake increases with combo (tactile)
  3. Hit freeze creates impact moment (timing)
  4. Death explosion spawns 20 particles (reward)
  5. Combo counter updates (progression)
  6. Score increases (validation)
```

### Power-Up Pickup Loop
```
Touch power-up →
  1. Ring particles burst out (immediate feedback)
  2. Color matches type (clarity)
  3. Light screen shake (tactile confirmation)
  4. UI updates instantly (visual validation)
  5. Effect activates (power fantasy)
```

### Combat Feel Multipliers
- **1x combo**: Modest shake, standard particles
- **3x combo**: Increased shake, more satisfying
- **5x combo**: Heavy shake, screen vibrates
- **10x+ combo**: Maximum dopamine, massive feedback

## 🎮 Movement Feel

### Player Movement
**Before**: Instant snap-to-cursor (robotic)  
**After**: Smooth acceleration with momentum (responsive + satisfying)

**Tuning**:
- Acceleration: `0.12` (quick but not instant)
- Deceleration: `0.25` (stops precisely)
- Max speed: `900 units/s` (unchanged)

**Feel**: Like driving a nimble sports car - responsive but with weight

### Enemy Movement
**Before**: Direct linear pursuit (boring)  
**After**: Steering behaviors with momentum (natural + threatening)

**Tuning**:
- Turn speed: `0.18` (smooth curves)
- Steering force: `10.0x delta` (responsive)
- Max speed: Scales with score (progressive difficulty)

**Feel**: Like being chased by intelligent predators, not robots

2. **Shield pickup when at 1 HP** - Close call + safety = relief dopamine
3. **Damage boost multi-kill** - Power fantasy fulfillment
4. **Last-second dodge with knockback** - Skill expression reward

### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High Satisfaction Events
1. **Any combo kill 3x+** - Progression validation
2. **Heart pickup** - Problem solved

## 🚀 How to Test

### Native (Desktop)
```bash
cargo run --release
```

**Test sequence**:
1. Kill 5-10 enemies - observe particles and shake
2. Build to 3x combo - notice shake increase
3. Get hit intentionally - feel heavy shake + knockback
4. Collect all 3 power-up types - observe ring colors
5. Build 10x+ combo - maximum dopamine test

### Web (Browser)
```bash
trunk serve --release
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

**Test sequence**:
Same as native, plus:
- Verify particles render correctly
- Check for FPS drops
- Confirm shake works on web

## ⚙️ Tuning Variables

All constants are at the top of `src/main.rs`:

```rust
// Game Feel Constants
const SCREEN_SHAKE_DECAY: f32 = 3.0;           // Shake fade speed
const ENEMY_KNOCKBACK: f32 = 250.0;            // Enemy hit force
const PLAYER_KNOCKBACK_STRENGTH: f32 = 200.0;  // Player hit force
const HIT_FREEZE_DURATION: f32 = 0.04;         // Impact pause
const PLAYER_ACCELERATION: f32 = 0.12;         // Movement smoothness
const PLAYER_DECELERATION: f32 = 0.25;         // Stopping speed
const ENEMY_TURN_SPEED: f32 = 0.18;            // Enemy steering
```

### If it feels...
**Too "floaty"**: Increase `PLAYER_ACCELERATION` to 0.15-0.20  
**Too "snappy"**: Decrease `PLAYER_ACCELERATION` to 0.08-0.10  
**Enemies turn too fast**: Decrease `ENEMY_TURN_SPEED` to 0.12  
**Not enough shake**: Increase shake amounts in collision handlers  
**Too much shake**: Decrease shake amounts or increase `SCREEN_SHAKE_DECAY`  
**Hit freeze annoying**: Decrease `HIT_FREEZE_DURATION` to 0.02

- Visual (particles, knockback)
- Tactile (screen shake)
- Temporal (hit freeze)
- Auditory (ready for sound effects)
- Numeric (score, combo)

### Escalation
**Rewards scale with skill**:
- Combo system multiplies satisfaction
- Shake intensity grows with combos
- Kill chain creates crescendo effect

### Anticipation → Reward Loops
