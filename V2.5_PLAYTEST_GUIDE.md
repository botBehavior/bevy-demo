## 🧪 Critical Tests (Must Verify)

### Test 1: Map is Actually Big Now ⭐ CRITICAL
**V2 Bug**: Map was still 1024x768 despite claiming 5000x5000!

**How to Test**:
1. Start game
2. Hold mouse in one direction
3. Move for 10+ seconds
4. **Expected**: Keep moving smoothly, background tiles repeat
5. **Bug Fixed If**: You travel far beyond 512 units from origin

**What You'll Feel**:
- ✅ Infinite space exploration
- ✅ Background seamlessly repeats
- ✅ No edge collision

---

### Test 2: Background Actually Works ⭐ CRITICAL
**V2 Bug**: Background was static 3x3 grid that didn't follow!

**How to Test**:
1. Move in a large circle
2. Watch background tiles
3. **Expected**: Tiles dynamically appear/disappear as you move
4. **Bug Fixed If**: Background follows camera, no black gaps

**What You'll See**:
- ✅ Tiles spawn ahead of you
- ✅ Tiles despawn behind you
- ✅ Always 5x5 grid visible
- ✅ Seamless tiling

### Test 3: Wave Weapon Redesign ⭐ NEW FEATURE
**V2 System**: Straight projectile burst (felt generic)  
**V2.5 System**: Curved fish-tail ocean waves

**How to Test**:
1. Press **Q** to switch to Wave mode
2. **Move in circles** while enemies chase
3. Watch the wave trails

**What You'll See**:
- ✅ Waves spawn from your sides (symmetric)
- ✅ Waves curve outward in arcs
- ✅ Waves only appear when moving
- ✅ Creates beautiful flow patterns

**Gameplay Feel**:
- Move = Attack (no clicking needed!)
- Circle enemies = Vortex damage
- Standing still = No waves (strategic)
- **Feels like**: Swimming fish, ocean waves

---

### Test 4: Accuracy Power-Up ⭐ NEW FEATURE
**What It Does**: Makes movement snappier, less drift

**How to Test**:
1. Play for 2-3 minutes
2. Notice how character moves (has momentum/drift)
3. Collect purple 🎯 Accuracy power-up
4. Notice movement feels more responsive
5. Collect 2-3 more Accuracy power-ups
6. Movement should feel almost instant

**What You'll Feel**:
- **0 stacks**: Smooth momentum-based
- **1 stack**: +8% snappier response
- **2 stacks**: +16% very responsive
- **3+ stacks**: +24%+ laser-precise

**Test Tip**: Try tight dodging before/after collecting Accuracy
