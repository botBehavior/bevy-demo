# 🎮 Play Threadweaver V2 - Quick Start

**Status**: ✅ Ready to Play!  
**Version**: 2.0 - Infinite Space Edition

---

## 🚀 Launch the Game

```bash
cargo run --release
```

**First time?** Compilation takes ~2 minutes. After that, instant launch!

---

## 🕹️ Controls (Simple!)

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Mouse** | Aim direction |
| **Q** | Switch weapon (Trail ↔ Wave) |
| **ESC** | Pause/Resume |
| **SPACE** | Restart (after death) |

**Note**: Cursor auto-locks when game starts. Press ESC to unlock.

---

## ⚔️ Two Weapon Modes

### Trail Mode (Default)
- Leaves glowing cyan trail behind you
- Trail damages enemies on contact
- Good for: Defense, area control, trapping

### Wave Mode (Press Q)
- Shoots 5 projectiles in spread pattern
- Fire rate: Every 0.35 seconds
- Good for: Offense, range, active combat

**Tip**: Try both! Different situations need different tools.

---

## 🎯 How to Survive

1. **Keep Moving** - Standing still = death
2. **Build Combos** - Kill enemies within 1 second of each other
3. **Chase Power-Ups** - They're rare (15% chance) but powerful
4. **Use Shield Wisely** - Only lasts 4 seconds, save for emergencies
5. **Experiment with Weapons** - Wave for bosses, Trail for crowds

---

## 💎 Power-Ups (Color-Coded)

| Color | Type | Effect |
|-------|------|--------|
| 🔴 **Red** | Heart | +1 Health |
| 🔵 **Cyan** | Shield | 4s Invincibility |
| 🟡 **Gold** | Damage | +50% Damage (stacks!) |

---

## 📊 Your Stats

- **Health**: 4 HP (you start fragile!)
- **Speed**: 950 units/s (fast & responsive)
- **Trail Damage**: 3 per tick (powerful early)
- **Wave Damage**: 2 per projectile

**Death is Fast**: This is intentional! Learn from each run.

## 🎮 Gameplay Loop

```
Move → Aim → Attack (Trail or Wave) → 
  Kill Enemies → Build Combo →

## 🎊 Have Fun!

Remember:
- **Deaths are lessons** - Each one teaches something
- **Combos are king** - Chain kills for massive scores
- **Weapons are tools** - Use the right one for the situation
- **Movement is life** - Never stop moving

**The game is hard. That's the point.** 🎮

But when you nail a 10x combo, destroy a wave of enemies, and barely survive with 1 HP?

**That's the dopamine hit we built this for.** 💯

---

## 🚀 Ready?

```bash
cargo run --release
```

**Press any key to start...**

*(Just kidding, there's no press-to-start screen yet. Game starts immediately!)* 😄

**Good luck, Threadweaver!** 🌟

May your combos be high and your deaths educational! 🎯
