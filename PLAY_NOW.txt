THREADWEAVER // PLAY NOW
=========================

HOW TO RUN (DEV BUILD)
  make web-dev        # launches trunk serve with live reload
  make web-release    # optimized WebGPU build into dist/
  cargo run -p threadweaver-launcher   # native sanity check (optional)

CORE CONTROLS
  Mouse / Touch drag   -> steer the Weaver
  Left Click / Space   -> confirm, slice with trail
  Gamepad South        -> confirm / interact
  Gamepad East / Esc   -> pause or close shop

UI & EXPERIENCE NOTES
  - HUD auto-converts to a compact bar below 720px width.
  - Upgrade shop stretches to full width on phones and keeps scrollable cards.
  - Focus highlight follows mouse, touch, and gamepad selection for parity.
  - Currency, upgrades, and theme selections persist between sessions (web + native).

GOOD TO KNOW
  - Keep moving to amplify trail damage and trigger power-up drops.
  - Shield pickups buy four seconds of invulnerability; save them for crowd bursts.
  - Wave weapon unlocks when your movement speed spikes; dash to fan projectiles.

Have fun weaving the thread!
