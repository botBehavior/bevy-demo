# Build & Deployment Status â€“ Threadweaver MVP

_Last updated: 2025-10-18_

## Deployment Readiness
- âœ… **WebAssembly build path configured** via Trunk + `index.html`; run `trunk build --release` to emit the static `dist/` bundle.
- âœ… **Vercel automation scripted** (`scripts/vercel-build.sh`) to install Rust, add the WASM target, and invoke Trunk in release mode.
- ðŸš§ **Production URL** pending first Vercel deployment run; trigger `vercel --prod` once repository is connected.

## Gameplay Slice Health
- âœ… Native build (`cargo run`) exercises the health-based survival loop with HUD updates, power-ups, and restart flow.
- âœ… Web build uses the same code path with canvas mounting, WASM panic hooks, and cursor lock handling.
- ðŸ”„ Upcoming polish: audio cues, particle feedback, touch controls, and persistent best-score storage per [docs/spec.md](spec.md).

## Success Metrics Checkpoint
- **30 FPS on mid-tier laptops** â€“ native build sustains >60 FPS; validate on Web deployment during testing.
- **First-play survival >45 seconds median** â€“ collect telemetry from remote testers via manual survey in next milestone.
- **Combo >3 achieved in 80% of runs** â€“ local instrumentation ready; add analytics hooks post Vercel launch.

## Next Steps
1. Connect the repository to Vercel and trigger the first production deployment for remote playtests.
2. Implement touch input and mobile-friendly HUD adjustments.
3. Add audio/particle feedback, then wire up IndexedDB persistence for high scores and run summaries.
