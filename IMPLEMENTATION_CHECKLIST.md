## ⏳ Deferred to V3

### Phase 3: Power-Up Choices (Complex)
- [ ] PowerUpType enum (12 types)
- [ ] Choice UI system
- [ ] Pause on choice
- [ ] Keyboard selection (1/2/3)
- [ ] Emoji icons
- [ ] Apply chosen effects

### Phase 4: Enemy Variants (Complex)
- [ ] EnemyVariant enum (6 types)
- [ ] Progressive unlocking
- [ ] Special abilities
- [ ] Color-coding
- [ ] Balance tuning

**Reason**: Both are substantial features (4-6 hours each). V2 already delivers massive value. Better to ship V2, gather feedback, then implement V3 based on that feedback.
