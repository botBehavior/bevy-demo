# Juicy Physics + Particles Implementation

**Status**: 🚧 IN PROGRESS  
**Goal**: Maximum dopamine, high-impact game feel

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

A game that feels like a **slot machine jackpot** every time you:
- Kill an enemy → Explosion + screen shake + particles
- Get hit → Knockback + flash + rumble feel  
- Pick up power-up → Ring burst + satisfying pop
- Build combo → Visual crescendo + multiplier pop

##  Implementation Strategy

Due to the complexity, implementing in phases:

### Phase A: Core Physics (Avian2D) ✅ Started
1. Add Avian imports
2. Initialize physics plugin
3. Add physics components to player
4. Add physics to enemies
5. Update movement systems

### Phase B: Game Feel Systems
1. Screen shake on impacts
2. Knockback effects
3. Hit freeze (brief pause)
4. Camera effects

### Phase C: Particle Effects (Hanabi)
1. Death explosions (PRIMARY - most dopamine)
2. Pickup effects  
3. Trail particles
4. Impact flashes

### Phase D: Polish & Tuning
1. Adjust timings
2. Tune shake intensities
3. Balance knockback
4. Perfect the feel

## 🔧 Current Approach

**Decision**: Implement via FOCUSED PULL REQUEST style

Instead of editing 50+ places in a 1000-line file, we'll:
1. Create new comprehensive `main_juicy.rs` with all features
2. Test it works
3. Replace `main.rs`

This is faster and safer than 50 individual edits.

## 🎮 Movement Feel

### Player
- Smooth acceleration (lerp 0.12)
- Quick deceleration (lerp 0.25)
- Momentum carries through turns
- Satisfying "weight" without sluggishness

### Enemies
- Steering behaviors (smooth curves)
- Knockback on trail hit
- Stagger effect when damaged
- Natural-looking pursuit

## ⚡ Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Method |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Particles | 200+ active | GPU (Hanabi) |
| FPS | 60 steady | Avian physics |
| Screen shake | No jitter | Smooth interpolation |
| Hit detection | Frame-perfect | Avian collision events |

## 🧪 Testing Plan

### Feel Testing
- [ ] Enemy death feels satisfying
- [ ] Player hit has impact
- [ ] Movement feels smooth
- [ ] Combo buildup exciting
- [ ] Power-ups feel rewarding

### Technical Testing  
- [ ] 60 FPS with 50 enemies
- [ ] 200+ particles no lag
- [ ] Physics stable
- [ ] No jitter or stuttering

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Current file size**: ~1050 lines  
**Estimated new size**: ~1400 lines (with juice systems)

**Why comprehensive rewrite**:
- Adding physics changes ~40% of systems
- Adding particles touches every enemy/pickup interaction
- Game feel systems integrate throughout
- Cleaner to rebuild than patch

**Safety**:
- ✅ Backup created (`main.rs.backup`)
- ✅ Can revert instantly if needed
- ✅ Test before replacing
